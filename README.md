🎮 How to Play?


  The game starts by lighting up a random LED.
  
  If the Green LED lights up, it signals that it is the player's turn.
  
  The player must repeat the LED sequence by pressing the buttons in the correct order.
  
  After a correct selection, a new color is added in the next round.
  
  If a wrong selection is made, a "Wrong Button" warning appears, and the game restarts.
